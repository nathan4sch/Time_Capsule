# CS 307 Project Charter

**Team 12:** Nathan Schneider, Kevin Jones, Evan Zimmerman, PJ Henwood

## Project Statement
Our project is a time capsule mobile application. An app that users can download and then receive monthly snapshots of their recent memories; from pictures to music, this immersive experience allows users to reminisce on the positive aspects of their month. The magic of our application is its automation: unlike other apps where the user is forced to spend the time creating their own monthly snapshot, our app gets downloaded and forgotten about… until the end of the month, when the user is surprised with a captivating, personalized visual and acoustic masterpiece!

## Project Objectives
- An automated app to remind you of your best memories from the month.
- An exciting interface to network with others and share your experiences.
- An intelligent algorithm to find the best photos, without the user needing to take the tedious time to find their favorite pictures.
- A full snapshot implemented through integration with Spotify to add personalized music.
- An editing feature that allows users to modify their snapshots if they have a different vision of their month.
- A personalized profile where users can connect with other friends to share and view other’s snapshots.
- A link to other social media sites such as Instagram to get your favorite post-worthy pictures in monthly memory.
- A streamlined automatic design process to present the snapshot as a modern, stylized piece ready to be shared.
- A process to select default photos and music in the case of limited personalization options.

## Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders of this project are Peter Henwood, Kevin Jones, Nathan Schneider, and Evan Zimmerman. All serve as a crucial part of the development team throughout the scrum process. The types of users we hope to attract are teenagers and young adults hoping to reminisce on their good times and connect with others, as well as older generations in search of a simple, user-friendly application that allows them to easily obtain engaging, personal snapshots.

## Deliverables
- The mobile application will be developed using React Native, allowing for IOS and Android compatibility.
- Expo will be used to handle the deployment of the app and enhance speed of development.
- A Node.js server will handle backend functionalities.
- AWS Hosting will be used for hosting and deploying backend components.
- Users will be able to create an account and login with Google Authenticator.
- The application will automate the process of creating personalized snapshots, capturing the highlights of each month.
- Google Cloud’s Vision API will scan the photos from the past month and find six noteworthy photos.
- Integration with the Spotify API will allow the monthly snapshot to display the user’s top three songs of the month.
- Each monthly snapshot will be automated; however, it will be highly customizable where the user can swap out photos and change the style.
- After receiving the snapshot, the user will be able to share it with friends and post it on social media.
