# Team 12 - CS 307 Product Backlog

## Project Name: Capsule

**Team Members:** Nathan Schneider, Kevin Jones, Evan Zimmerman, PJ Henwood

### Problem Statement

Our project is a time capsule mobile application. An app that users can download and then receive monthly snapshots (called capsules) of their recent memories; from pictures to music, this immersive experience allows users to reminisce on the positive aspects of their month. The magic of our application is its automation: unlike other apps where the user is forced to spend the time creating their own monthly snapshot, our app gets downloaded and forgotten about… until the end of the month, when the user is surprised with a captivating, personalized visual and acoustic masterpiece!

### Background Information:

#### Audience

As students with a fast paced lifestyle, time seems to go faster and good memories fall to the backs of our minds. This is the problem we hope to solve. We don’t have enough time to scroll through all our history of the past month and organize it to find our favorite moments. By automating this process, we can focus on our daily tasks and still be able to enjoy a recap of our good memories.

The types of users we hope to attract are teenagers and young adults hoping to reminisce on their good times and connect with others, as well as older generations in search of a simple, user-friendly application that allows them to easily obtain engaging, personal capsules.

#### Similar Platforms

We couldn’t find any platforms that do the same thing as Capsule, however there are a few apps that provide recaps themselves such as Google Photos, Apple Photos, Snapchat, and Spotify. All of these apps provide some sort of monthly/yearly recap within their own service.

#### Limitations

All of these apps provide great value to users with their individual recaps, but they are limited to their own apps. That leaves significant room for development of an app that combines all these recaps to provide the user with an all-encompassing time capsule. Many of the other apps also don't provide a good way to share your recap (besides spotify), which is another key point of our app. Additionally, our app creates one snapshot, so instead of flipping through many pictures, you see your entire month all at once. Other applications also often require the user to find their own photos.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Architecture

- We plan to develop an application with a completely separate frontend and backend. Using this structure will allow for better compatibility while developing both simultaneously. The frontend will consist of the user interface while the backend will consist of the application server and database.
- The frontend will be written in JavaScript using the React Native framework. This will allow us to have an extremely portable application that can be used cross-platform across mobile devices. For testing and demo purposes we intend to use Expo Go, which will allow us to see our app on our phones without requiring any of us to have an Apple computer.
- The backend will be a Node.js server hosted on an Amazon Web Service (AWS) EC2 instance. We will use API calls to this server to access information that will be used on the frontend.
- The database will be MongoDB. Here we will store user info such as snapshots, friends, and usernames. Using MongoDB’s flexible schema we can have varied ways to store information making MongoDB a good choice for flexible development

#### Security

- Security is crucial to protect our client’s snapshots and login data. Using Google's authentication services with ReactNative we will ensure only users with correct login data may request their data from the MongoDB database. We may allow users to create their username/password information, but for now, we plan on just using G-Auth because it provides its own security. We will also be routing every request for information through our API, which will require authentication.

#### Usability

- Since the app has such a wide range of potential users, the interface must be extremely intuitive. We intend to design it in such a way that the user should have to do as little work as possible. This means that after the initial setup (linking other accounts/apps to get data) the user interface will be relatively simple. The bulk of the app will focus on receiving and modifying the monthly snapshot, which will be easy for users to understand. The app frontend will also be accessible on different types/sizes of mobile devices and will run smoothly because we used a modern stack that can support requests times up to 500 ms.

#### Hosting/Deployment

- Our frontend and backend are developed separately, which means that their deployment will be in different places as well. Our backend will be hosted on an AWS EC2 instance for the semester and beyond, we chose AWS because it's a reliable service that we can have running 24 hours a day. The frontend will be deployed for testing on Expo Go, and we intend to explore other options for deployment to the public (potentially GitHub pages or Netlify).
